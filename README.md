# php-ml

PHP-ML is a machine learning library for PHP programming language. It provides a set of tools for building machine learning models, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, regression, clustering, and other techniques.

Some of the key features of PHP-ML include:

Simple and easy to use: PHP-ML is designed to be simple and easy to use for developers who are new to machine learning. Its API is designed to be user-friendly, so you can quickly get started with building machine learning models.

Built-in algorithms: PHP-ML includes a range of built-in algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and other tasks. This means that you can easily implement common machine learning techniques without having to write your own code.

Flexibility: PHP-ML is designed to be flexible and modular, so you can easily use it with your existing PHP codebase. It also supports a range of data formats, so you can work with different types of data.

Performance: PHP-ML is built to be fast and efficient, so it can handle large datasets and complex machine learning models.

Open source: PHP-ML is an open-source project, which means that it is freely available for anyone to use and contribute to.

<-- Steps to follow after downloading the code-->


A Web Server is required to run the files such as xampp,wampp,etc.
Place the files in a folder,place the folder under htdocs in xampp.

The linear regression model works fine on any device.

To run the Decision Tree Model,Please install python on your device.
Then install numpy,pandas,scikit-learn packages.

To run the svm model,you need to create a database with table of required fields and data
